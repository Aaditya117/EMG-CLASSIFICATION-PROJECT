# EMG-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT
(Project done under Dr. Suman Samui at NIT Rourkela)

Developed a multi-class classification system for EMG signal using standard classifiers
(Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Tree classifier) and also increased the 
accuracy of these classifiers by ensembling techniques.

Objective was to classify Upper limb position-invariant EMG Signals using non-invasive 
methods to design prosthetic for amputees.
